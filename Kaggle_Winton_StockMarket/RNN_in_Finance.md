# Applying Recurrent Neural Networks in Financial Time Series

1. Introduction to RNN [Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).

   [DNN versus CNN versus RNN](http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~stanchen/spring16/e6870/slides/lecture14.pdf).

2. An awesome demonstration of sample code of [Predict Stock Prices Using RNN](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/07/08/predict-stock-prices-using-RNN-part-1.html) for beginners. [Source code](https://github.com/lilianweng/stock-rnn)

3. Another simple python example of [LSTM Neural Network for SP500 Time Series Prediction](https://github.com/jaungiers/LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction).
